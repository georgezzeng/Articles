  UW-Madison’s research computing hardware recently underwent a substantial hardware refresh, adding 207 new servers representing over 40,000 “batch slots” of computing capacity. This refresh and plan of an annual commitment at the campus level to sustain it will allow UW researchers to push the limits of their research on an all-new sustained shared infrastructure. The funding for this was made possible by a $4.3 million investment from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), which will remove some of the worries for individual PIs of having to stand up their own facilities. Now, researchers will have a sustainable computational infrastructure to harness more computing capacity and produce computationally heavy research results more efficiently.

  The research computing investments, equipment upgrades, and services to support researchers were made possible by the growing collaboration between:
  - [Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF)](https://www.warf.org/)
  - [Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC)](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) in the [School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences (CDIS)](https://cdis.wisc.edu/)
  - [Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org/)
  - [Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education (OVCRGE)](https://research.wisc.edu/about/)
  - [Division of Information Technology (DoIT)](https://it.wisc.edu/about/division-of-information-technology/)
