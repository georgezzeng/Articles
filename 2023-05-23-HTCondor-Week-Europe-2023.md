We are very pleased to announce that the 2023 European HTCondor Workshop will be held from Tuesday 19th September to Friday 22nd September, at IJCLab in Orsay, France.

To allow ease of travel to and from the venue the meeting will start at on Tuesday morning and run until lunchtime on the Friday.

Registration is now open at the meeting Indico site: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1274213/

There will be a small workshop fee of €160 to cover lunches, teas and coffees, and a social dinner on the Thursday evening.

The workshop will be an excellent occasion for learning from the experts (the developers!) about HTCondor, exchanging with your colleagues about experiences and plans, and providing your feedback to the experts.

The HTCondor Compute Entrypoint (CE) will be covered as well as with token authentication (currently a hot topic), along with general use and administration of HTCondor.

Participation is open to all organisations (including companies) and persons interested in HTCondor (and by no means restricted to particle physics and/or academia!) If you know potentially interested persons, don't hesitate to make them aware of this opportunity.

The workshop will cover both using and administering HTCondor; topics will be chosen to best match participants' interests.

We would very much like to know about your use of HTCondor, in you project, your experience and your plans. Hence you are warmly encouraged to propose a short presentation.

If you have any questions, please contact hepix-2023condorworkshop-support@hepix.org.

We are looking forward to a rich, productive workshop.

Chris Brew (STFC - RAL) and Christoph Beyer (DESY)
Co-Chairs of organising committee.

Chair of the Local Organising Committee
